# Hi, I'm Dylan McCavitt

I'm a graduate CS student at Stevens Institute of Technology, graduating in Fall 2025.

## what I work with
- **Languages:** JS/TS, Python, Java, SQL
- **Web & Backend:** Node.js, Expres, Astro/React, REST APIs
- **Databsases:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL (coursework)
- **Tooling** Git, Docker, Linux

I enjoy messing around with some NixOS and a small homelab setup in my free time. 

## Currently learning / focusing on / want to learn

- **Go** for backend services and CLIs
- **Backend architecture:** better API design, auth, testing and deployment
- **More reliable infra/dev environments:** applying what I mess with in NixOS and homelab to some real projects where applicable

## Selected projects

Some of my projects are private (for coursework or in-progress work), but here’s an overview of what I’ve been building:

- **Bella’s Beads (Private) [finished but still integrating]**
- bellasbeads.shop
  Full-stack e-commerce store for handmade jewelry.  
  *Stack:* React + TypeScript, Node/Express, Stripe, transactional email, and a hosted Postgres backend.  
  I handled everything on this site.

- **Work Order Management System (Course Project)**  
  Web app for tracking work orders, companies, and users.  
  *Stack:* Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Handlebars, server-side validation and authentication.

- **Band Website – NHF**  
  Static site for local band using Astro + Tailwind, with custom icons, show calendar integration (Google calendar API), and responsive layout.

- **NixOS / Dotfiles (Hobby)**  
  Declarative configs for my development environment (NixOS, home-manager, terminal + editor setup) to keep all my machines consistent.

I’ll gradually open-source more code and add screenshots / write-ups as projects stabilize.
